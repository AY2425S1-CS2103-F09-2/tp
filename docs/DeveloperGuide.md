### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of
classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java)
and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is
in charge of the app launch and shut down.

* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues
the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding
  API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using
the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component
through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the
implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified
in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts
e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`,
inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the
visible GUI.

The UI for the Single page person view is a standalone UI window that is called through the functionalities of the
application itself.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that
are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of
the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified
in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API
** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API
call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates
   a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which
   is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take
   several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a
  placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse
  the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as
  a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser`
  interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**API
** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which
  is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to
  this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as
  a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they
  should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>

### Storage component

**API
** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding
  objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only
  the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects
  that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo
history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the
following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€” Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€” Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€” Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()`
and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the
initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command
calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes
to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book
state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also
calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into
the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing
the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer`
once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.png)

The `redo` command does the opposite â€” it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once
to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such
as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`.
Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not
pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be
purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern
desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
    * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
    * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**

* Real estate agents
* Need manage a large number of clients with varying details
* Need to record past engagement with clients
* Can type fast
* Prefers typing to mouse interactions
* Is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**: 
This app helps real estate agents efficiently manage client relationships by centralizing contact details and logging
interactions. Also, automated reminders and notes ensure that you never miss an opportunity to engage clients. It
simplifies client management but focuses only on handling moderate-sized contact lists, without support for financial
transactions, property details, or large-scale CRM functions.

### Use cases

(For all use cases below, the **System** is the `AddressBook` and the **Actor** is the `user`, unless specified
otherwise)

**Use case: Delete a person**

**MSS**

1. User requests to list persons
2. AddressBook shows a list of persons
3. User requests to delete a specific person in the list
4. AddressBook deletes the person

   Use case ends.

**Extensions**

* 2a. The list is empty.

  Use case ends.

* 3a. The given index is invalid.

    * 3a1. AddressBook shows an error message.

      Use case resumes at step 2.

Let's move on to the next use case based on **Feature 3: Alphabetical Sorting of Contact List by Name**. Following the structure from the document, this use case will also include references to related use cases where applicable.

---

### Use Case: **UC02 - Sort Contact List Alphabetically**
**Actor**: Salesperson  
**Precondition**: The system has a non-empty list of contacts.  
**Guarantees**: The contact list is sorted in the specified order (ascending or descending), and the Salesperson can view the sorted list.

#### Main Success Scenario (MSS):
1. The Salesperson issues the `sort` command with a specified order (ascending or descending).
2. The system validates the sorting parameter (`asc` or `desc`).
3. The system sorts the contact list based on the specified order.
4. The sorted contact list is displayed.
5. The system shows a success message: "Contacts sorted in `<ascending/descending>` order."

   **Use case ends.**

---

#### Extensions:
- **2a.** The entered sorting parameter is invalid (e.g., `ascending` instead of `asc`).
    - **2a1.** The system displays an error message: "Error: Invalid sorting order. Use 'asc' for ascending or 'desc' for descending."
    - **2a2.** The Salesperson corrects the sorting parameter and reissues the command.
    - **Use case resumes from Step 2.**

- **2b.** The Salesperson forgets to specify the sorting order.
    - **2b1.** The system displays an error message: "Error: No sorting order provided. Please specify 'asc' or 'desc'."
    - **2b2.** The Salesperson adds the correct sorting order and reissues the command.
    - **Use case resumes from Step 2.**

---

#### Including Related Use Cases:
This use case includes the following related use cases:
- **UC03 - Validate Command Parameters**: This use case is referenced in Step 2 for validating the sorting parameter entered by the Salesperson.

---

#### Variations:
- **1a.** The Salesperson issues the `sort asc` command to sort the contacts in ascending order.
    - **Use case proceeds normally from Step 2.**

- **1b.** The Salesperson issues the `sort desc` command to sort the contacts in descending order.
    - **Use case proceeds normally from Step 2.**

---

#### Postconditions:
- The contact list is displayed in the specified alphabetical order. The system does not change the underlying data, only the view of the contact list.

---

Let's proceed with the next few use cases, following the same detailed structure. I'll cover the **Interaction History Log for Each Contact**, **Find Function**, and **Add or Edit Remarks for a Contact** use cases.

---

### Use Case: **UC03 - Log Interaction with Contact**
**Actor**: Salesperson  
**Precondition**: The contact already exists in the contact list.  
**Guarantees**: The interaction details are logged under the specified contact's history for future reference.

#### Main Success Scenario (MSS):
1. The Salesperson issues the `log` command with the required `ContactID` and interaction details.
2. The system validates the `ContactID` and interaction details.
3. The system logs the interaction for the specified contact.
4. The system displays a success message: "Interaction logged for contact `<ContactID>`."
5. The interaction history is updated in the contact's profile.

   **Use case ends.**

---

#### Extensions:
- **2a.** The `ContactID` is invalid or does not exist.
    - **2a1.** The system displays an error message: "Error: Contact not found. Please check the `ContactID` and try again."
    - **2a2.** The Salesperson corrects the `ContactID` and reissues the command.
    - **Use case resumes from Step 2.**

- **2b.** The interaction details are missing.
    - **2b1.** The system displays an error message: "Error: Interaction details are required."
    - **2b2.** The Salesperson adds the interaction details and reissues the command.
    - **Use case resumes from Step 2.**

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Portability:**
- The app should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `17` or above installed.

2. **Performance:**
  - The app should be able to hold up to 1000 persons without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
  - The search and sort functions should return results within 2 seconds for the average number of contacts.

3. **Efficiency**
  - A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be
    able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.

4. **Usability:**
  - The interface should be intuitive, requiring less than 15 minutes of training for a real estate agent to become proficient.
  - The app should provide clear error messages for incorrect inputs (e.g., invalid phone numbers, dates) and guide the user in correcting them.

5. **Reliability:**
  - The app must have an uptime of at least 99.5% during business hours.
  - Data, such as contacts and interaction logs, should be autosaved after each modification, ensuring no loss of data during usage.

6. **Scalability:**
  - While optimized for a moderate number of contacts (up to 1000), the app should still function with reduced performance for up to 2,000 contacts.

7. **Maintainability:**
  - The codebase should follow standard code style and be modular, ensuring ease of updates and bug fixes.
  - The app should allow easy export and import of contact data for backup or migration purposes.
